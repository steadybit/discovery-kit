# Examples

We offer several examples that you may find helpful to understand and get started with DiscoveryKit:

- [Node.js-based cat discovery](/examples/nodejs-example-discovery): This example implements a discovery that registers a target type `cat`, its attributes and
  discovers some `cat`-targets. This example is handy for understanding the discovery API call flow and request and response structures.
