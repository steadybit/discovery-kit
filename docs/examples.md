# Examples

We offer several examples that you may find helpful to understand and get started with DiscoveryKit:

- [Node.js-based cat discovery](/examples/nodejs-example-discovery): This example implements a discovery that registers a target type `cat` and `dog`, its
  attributes and discovers some `cat`- and `dog`- targets. This example is handy for understanding the discovery API call flow and request and response
  structures.
