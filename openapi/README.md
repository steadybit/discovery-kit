# OpenAPI Specification

This OpenAPI specification defines the necessary schemas that DiscoveryKit extension users will find helpful
while implementing.

Please note that we publish a [Go](https://github.com/steadybit/discovery-kit/tree/main/go/discovery_kit_api) package capturing these schemas for ease of development.
